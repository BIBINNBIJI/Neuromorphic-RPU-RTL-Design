# Neuromorphic-RPU-RTL-Design
Designing and verifying a Robotic Processing Unit (RPU) based on neuromorphic principles is a highly innovative and research-intensive project. This architecture is inspired by the human brain's structure and behavior and aims to enhance robotic intelligence with real-time, energy-efficient processing. 
# 🧠 Neuromorphic RPU – RTL Design

This repository contains synthesizable Verilog/SystemVerilog RTL for a **Neuromorphic Robotic Processing Unit (RPU)** inspired by biological spiking neural networks.

## 🚀 Overview

This RPU processes sensor input through spiking neurons, updates synaptic weights using STDP, and triggers motor outputs based on spiking behavior. It’s ideal for low-power, event-driven robotics and edge-AI applications.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Key RTL Blocks:
| Module             | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `neuron_core.v`    | Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) digital neuron |
| `synapse_array.v`  | SRAM-based weight storage with learning |
| `axon_interface.v` | Spike router between neurons |
| `rpu_controller.v` | FSM controller for learning/reset/run |
| `sensor_interface.v` | Converts sensor data to spike events |
| `actuator_driver.v` | Generates motor control commands |
| `learning_engine.v` | STDP-based delta weight calculator |
| `noc_bus.v`        | (Optional) interconnect for multi-neuron network |
| `rpu_top.v`        | Top module integrating all components |

Let me know if you'd like me to also prepare:
- `.gitignore` for Verilog projects
- Diagrams for the `doc/` folder
- FPGA-specific constraints or top-level wrappers

I'm happy to help you build this into a complete GitHub-ready design!

# Neuromorphic-RPU-RTL-Design
Designing and verifying a Robotic Processing Unit (RPU) based on neuromorphic principles is a highly innovative and research-intensive project. This architecture is inspired by the human brain's structure and behavior and aims to enhance robotic intelligence with real-time, energy-efficient processing.
